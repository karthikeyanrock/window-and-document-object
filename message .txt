Document Object: 
The document object represent a web page that is loaded in the browser. 
By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page.
 With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. 
The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

The window object represents an open window in a browser.
 If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), 
 the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and
 one additional window object for each frame.
